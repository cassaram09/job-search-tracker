Job Search Tracker helps job seekers track, organize, and manage their job search.

In addition to providing the basic functions of a CRM to manage relationships with 
employers and people in your network, Job Search Tracker also allows you to track
your online "portfolio activity." What does this mean?

It's not enough to just search and apply for jobs. Job seekers are expected to expand 
and leverage their network of connections to find the right job. On top of that, having
a strong, active, and consistent online presence shows that you take your profession
seriously. It also helps you from getting rusty!
